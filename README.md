Jira.vim
=========

Everyone's Jira is configured differently.
This is unlikely to work for anyone else.

Configuration
-------------

In your vimrc:

```
let g:jira_domain = 'https://my.jira.com'
```


Completions
-----------

Type <project>-<search term> then trigger omnicomplete (`ctrl-x ctrl-o` by default)


Working with GitHub, GitLab or other git repos
----------------------------------------------

Sometimes you use Jira for issue completion but you might want to still complete
other things from the GitHub or other providers.

TODO: document this.
